About
------

I'm a third year Ph. D. student majoring in Theoretical and Computational Chemistry at Southern Methodist University. I'm also pursuing a MS in Computer Science at Georgia Tech. I'm expected to graduate in 2023 spring. 

My research mainly lies in machine learning and molecular dynamics simulations. Currently, I focus on: (1) decipher protein allostery through machine learning based methods; (2) understand protein conformations through artificial intelligence.
