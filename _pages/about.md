About
------
I'm a third year Ph. D. student majoring in Theoretical and Computational Chemistry at Southern Methodist University. I'm also pursuing a MS in Computer Science at Georgia Tech. I'm expected to graduate in 2023 spring. My resume PDF is available <a href= "https://github.com/htian97/htian97.github.io/blob/master/files/resume.pdf">here</a>.

My research mainly lies in machine learning and molecular dynamics simulations. Currently, I focus on: (1) decipher protein allostery through machine learning based methods; (2) understand protein conformations through artificial intelligence.

Feel free to contact me for research collaborations and software developer jobs.

**I will join Facebook as a software engineer intern in machine learning from May 2022.**
